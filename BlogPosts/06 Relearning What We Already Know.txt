A professor of mine mentioned a podcast during an interactive design class. In fact, he insisted that we listen to it. Since that class, 99% Invisible has had a permanent home in my podcast client du jour. Episode 149, Of Mice and Men, talked about the vision that Doug Engelbart had for personal computers. Engelbart, to paraphrase the podcast, believed that by relearning how we interact with the computer we could open a greater number of more meaningful ways in which computers affect our lives. As such, Engelbart thought it best to interact with computers not with keyboards but with a three-button mouse (Engelbart invented the mouse) and a keyset. A keyset is a five-button input device to be used in unison with the mouse. Engelbart, a true visionary, talked in the 1968 about many of the things we take for granted today. Take a look at a talk he gave, which is often referred to as the “Mother of All Demos."

I mention Engelbart and his idea of relearning the computer because, to me, the Elm language (and Functional Reactive Programming) seem so foreign. I consider myself to be not much of a programmer at all. I have some experience. I can do some basic stuff. But I look at people I admire and respect as programmers, and I just do not see myself ever approaching what they can do. This may be imposter syndrome. Learning Elm will be my “Engelbart Moment” with regards to programming. I am optimistic that I will open those doors that lead to a richer experience that Engelbart believes exist.
