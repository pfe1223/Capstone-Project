When _why left the Internet, fans and believers in his work cloned his GitHub repository, and volunteers took over his projects. Hackety Hack is a labor of love, worked on by volunteers. One of the main people behind the renewed interest in Hackety Hack, Steve Klabnik, took a position Rust team. As such, other people wanted to spirit of Hackety Hack to live on; thus, KidsRuby was born. There are a lot of similarities between KidsRuby and Hackety Hack. KidsRuby makes no secret of _why's influence on their work. There is an interpreter on the left and documentation on the right. Some of the tutorials were taken directly from Hackety Hack. KidsRuby, even uses the same colors from Hackety Hack for turtle art.

There are some shortcomings though. I cannot get it to install on my Mac. The laptop on which I am currently writing this is not new, nor is it terribly old. It is running Yosemite, but it is in desperate need of some more memory. I find it hard that KidsRuby will not install given that all Macs come with Ruby installed. My personal gripe aside, KidsRuby uses the local file system to open and save files. You have to use the ".rb" extension in the file name for KidsRuby to be able to run the program. Overall, KidsRuby seems to be nothing more than a slightly updated clone of Hackety Hack. Perhaps my opinion is harsh and unfair. I wish KidsRuby had put in the time and effort to not only keep the work of _why alive, but to evolve and extend it.

Lest you think I dislike KidsRuby, I have been installing it on all of the computers in my lab, as Hackety Hack has a propensity to suddenly crash. I will be having my students evaluate KidsRuby as it compares to the Khan Academy version of JavaScript. I look forward to their thoughts.
