# Capstone-Project
Making Elm more accessible to beginning programmers

This project is my capstone. I am looking to rethink how we teach programming to beginner students. For more details on the process of my project, please see my blog - www.patr1ck.net.

If you want to see what the final project is, clone the repo, run elm-reactor, and load index2.html in your browser.
